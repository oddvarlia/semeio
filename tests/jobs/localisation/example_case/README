Directory for test case for non-adaptive localisation (LOCALISATION_JOB)
Main components:
ERT config file: sim_field.ert

The ERT model depends on:
scripts/sim_fields.py

ERT input:
GRID keyword: GRID.EGRID  - can be generated by the script sim_fields.py
time_map.txt
localisation.wf


Other files:
randomseeds.txt - Not used by ERT, but by sim_fields.py
                               This file can be generated by sim_fields.py
UpscaledGrid.EGRID - Not used by ERT, but by sim_fields.py
                                     This file can be generated by sim_fields.py


How to use the script sim_fields.py:
The main has some (global) variables turning on/off various options:
make_seed_file:  To create the file randomseeds.txt
write_file_grid:   To create the grid file GRID.EGRID
write_coarse_grid:  To create the coarse grid file UpscaleGrid.EGRID
write_upscaled_to_file:  Write upscaled field values to file for QC purpose. Not mandatory.
write_obs_pred_diff_field_file:  Write field for the coarse grid containing difference of observed values minus predicted obs values.
extract_and_write_obs: Extract observations for the selected grid cells and write to ERT observation files. Generate local_config.yml

Typical workflow:
1. Generate seed file and the grid files by activating the relevant options mentioned above and run scripts/sim_fields.py
2. Create sub-directory observations and observations/obs_data
3. Edit the setting dictionaries in sim_fields.py to change the current settings if wanted.
3. Generate observation files and local_config.yml file by running scripts/sim_fields.py
4. Turn off the above mentioned options, but set write_upscaled_to_file active (and optionally write_obs_pred_diff_field_file)
5. Activate/not activate localisation in ERT config file (HOOK_WORKFLOW  LOAD_WORKFLOW for localisation)
6. Now ready to run ERT.
